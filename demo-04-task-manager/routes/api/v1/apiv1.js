// Purpose: Handles routes specific to version 1 of the API.
// Description: Although it's currently a placeholder, in a more complex application,
// it would define endpoints related to the API, such as retrieving, creating, updating, or deleting data. By versioning the API (v1),
//  it becomes easier to introduce non-breaking changes in future versions.
